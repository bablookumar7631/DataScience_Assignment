    "### Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans:-\n",
    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), and they are closely related but serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction:**\n",
    "1. Definition: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential attributes and behaviors of real-world objects while ignoring non-essential details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Purpose: Abstraction aims to provide a clear and abstract view of an object, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. It helps manage complexity and allows you to create a high-level view of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example: In a car, we abstract away many details. For instance, we don't need to know how the engine works to drive a car. We only need to know how to use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift to control the car's essential functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation:**\n",
    "1. Definition: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling an object's attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on those attributes into a single unit (a class). It hides the internal implementation details of an object and restricts direct access to its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Purpose: Encapsulation is used to protect an object's integrity by preventing unauthorized access or modification of its internal state. It also promotes the principle of information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example: Consider a bank account class. It encapsulates the account balance and provides methods like deposit and withdraw to interact with the balance. The internal balance is not directly accessible from outside the class, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans:-\n",
    "The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It is a module in the Python standard library that provides mechanisms for defining and working with abstract base classes. Abstract base classes serve as blueprints for other classes and are used for creating a common interface that subclasses are expected to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features and purposes of the abc module:**\n",
    "1. Abstract Base Classes: The primary purpose of the abc module is to facilitate the creation of abstract base classes. Abstract base classes define a set of methods that subclasses must implement. They act as a contract or interface that ensures certain methods are available in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enforcement of Interfaces: Abstract base classes allow you to define interfaces in Python. This means you can create a common set of methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring consistency and providing clear expectations for how classes should behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Prevention of Instantiation: Abstract base classes cannot be instantiated themselves. They are meant to be subclassed, and the abstract methods they define must be implemented in concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. isinstance() and issubclass() Functions: The abc module provides functions like isinstance() and issubclass() that can be used to check if an object is an instance of a particular abstract base class or if a class is a subclass of an abstract base class."

You can achieve data abstraction in Python and other OOP languages through the following techniques:\n",
