    "Regularization in machine learning is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting, a phenomenon where a model memorizes the training data and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. Regularization methods introduce additional constraints or penalties to the model during training, discouraging it from becoming too complex or overemphasizing the noise in the training data.\n",

    "The primary purpose of regularization is to reduce the model's variance, making it more robust and less sensitive to fluctuations in the training data. By controlling the model's complexity, regularization helps strike a balance between bias and variance, leading to better generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Regularization is a powerful technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning : -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Controlling Model Complexity:\n",
    "Regularization adds a penalty term to the model's loss function, based on the model's complexity. By adjusting the strength of the regularization parameter, you can control the model's complexity. A higher regularization parameter penalizes large weights, making the model prefer simpler solutions with smaller weights. This helps prevent the model from fitting the noise in the data and encourages it to focus on the more relevant features.\n",

    "In regularization techniques like L1 regularization (Lasso), the penalty term encourages some model weights to be exactly zero. This effectively performs feature selection, as features associated with zero weights are considered irrelevant for the model's predictions. Removing irrelevant features reduces the model's complexity and helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weight Shrinkage:\n",
    "Regularization techniques like L2 regularization (Ridge) shrink the model's weights towards zero without making them exactly zero. This process is called weight shrinkage.
